### Classroom-Scene-Recognition
Classroom Scene Recognition for monitoring using MobileNet
Aug,2020 - Jan,2020             
• Extracted GIST, DAISY, and HOG for features and used SVM as a classifier. 
• Improved the accuracy to 90% by training the model with transfer learning using MobileNet and Keras.
• Applied Haar classifier for detecting and counting faces, and CNN for the gender of the faces with an accuracy of 94%.
